Version 0.1.0 - All Versions before 2020-06-01
----------------------------------------------
> Created phot2lc.py as a python replacement for
  WQED. Included just the basic functionality
  to work with output from Antonio Kanaan's
  IRAF hsp_nd and data from McDonald Observatory.

Version 1.0.0 - 2020-06-01
--------------------------
> Created the teledat.py and photfunc.py scripts
   -teledat.py stores information related to each 
      telescope and has a unique 4-letter code
      associated with each one. This script is
      similar in purpose to the file whiff.dat
      for WQED.
   -photfunc.py stores several functions used
      within the main script below. This was
      created just to help clean things up.
> Included functionality that allows phot2lc
    to be used with output from both hsp_nd and
    Maestro. For Maestro, only the "counts" files
    can currently be used.
> Improved the formatting for the .lc and .phot
    output files. The headers are now more easily
    readable and contain more information. There
    are also two time columns now, one for the raw
    uncorrected times, and one for the barycentric
    corrected times.

Version 1.1.0 - 2020-06-04
--------------------------
> Created a new function in photfunc.py, get_loc, 
    which gets the Astropy Earth Locations for each 
    telescope available in the teledat.py file
> Added LCOGT 1.0m telescopes to teledat.py with 
    codename 'lco1'
> Fixed bug related to object names. If object name
    taken from the FITS header has any spaces in it,
    those spaces will now be automatically removed, 
    since the object names in stars.dat cannot have 
    spaces.
> Removed plot that shows the size of apertures and
    sky annuli around each object. Too many issues, 
    and not a very useful plot.
> Fixed bug in get_time function. Times were being 
    improperly re-formatted when DATE-OBS was already 
    in ISO or ISOT in the FITS header. Now, these 
    times are fed directly into an Astropy Time object 
    which can auto-interpret the format.

Version 1.2.0 - 2020-06-09
--------------------------
> Added a new command line input parameter for
    providing the object name. Originally the object
    name was grabbed solely from the FITS header, but
    not all FITS files will have an object entry. The
    object name is required, however, for grabbing the
    corresping RA and Dec from the star.dat file.
    Judi Provencal recommended adding a command line
    option. The new command line option is -o, or 
    --object. By default this option is set to None,
    in which case the header is used.
> Changed activation and deactivation functionality 
    of the Garbage and Zoom rectangle selectors. 
    Originally, once activated with the "g" or "z" 
    input keys, they would remain active until 
    deactivated using the same input keys. This would
    lead to some confusion during use, as it was often 
    easy to forget one selector was activated which 
    then blocked activation of the other selector. 
    Now, each selector is automatically deactivated 
    after use, though it can still be manually 
    deactivated if, once a user activates it, they 
    realize they don't want to use it.
> Added a Reverse Garbage Selector which, when you 
    draw a box, will delete all of the points OUTSIDE 
    of the box rather than inside the box. This 
    feature can be activated and deactivated using 
    the "r" keyboard input.


Version 1.3.0 - 2020-06-12
--------------------------
> Added a sigma clipping function. This feature can
    be used with the "x" key. User will be prompted
    for their choice of lower and upper sigma 
    rejection thresholds. The user can also choose
    the window size, i.e. how many points are
    considered at a time when rejecting data points.
    Smaller windows are useful when dealing with
    stars that are variable on short timescales. The
    default window size is 25 data points.
> Changed periodogram calculation/plot so that it
    only goes out to 10,000 uHz, for easier viewing.
> Added "#!/usr/bin/env python" to script so it can
    be executed on the command line without having
    to invoke Python beforehand.
> Also removed .py extension on phot2lc so it looks
    more like a regular executable.
> Removed version history from phot2lc script, it now
    lives only in this text file.
> Cleaned up the inputs. Deleted some unused modules
    and reorganized the rest. Now checks to make sure
    the python version is 3.6 or later.
> Added a new configuration script, a convenience 
    function which new users can use to set the
    defaults. This was needed in order to prevent
    users from having to go into the code and manually
    change hard-coded variables in order to make
    phot2lc work. Now, the "photconfig" function can 
    be called which edits the config.dat file, which
    is then loaded into phot2lc during initialization.

Version 1.3.1 to 1.3.4 - 2020-06-13
-----------------------------------
> Made phot2lc into a python package available on PyPI
> Fixed bugs so that phot2lc and photconfig work
    properly once they have been pip installed



Version 1.4.0 - 2020-06-14
--------------------------
> Removed some extraneous print commands.
> Changed the light curve and photometry header
    descriptions for DATE, UTC, MJD, and BJED to be
    more descriptive.
> Finally got the weldlc functions working again with 
    the new .lc output formats. wildly can be used now 
    to stitch .lc files together for multi-night or
    multi-site data sets.



Version 1.4.1 - 2020-06-14
--------------------------
> Small changes to the PyPI README.md file


Version 1.4.2 - 2020-06-14
--------------------------
> config.dat didn't get uploaded with the previous
    version due to an error in setup.py. Fixed the
    error and this version appears fully functional.

Version 1.4.3 - 2020-06-14
--------------------------
> Forgot to include the most up-to-date version of
    this file (version_history.txt) with the last
    one. Now it should be complete.

Version 1.4.4 - 2020-06-15
--------------------------
> A few small bug fixes.
> Fixed an indexing error related to the grid search.
    The wrong index was being used to save information
    into the output .phot files related to the optimal 
    aperture being used when using "G" to save the
    final light curve. This has been fixed in this
    version.
    

Version 1.4.5 - 2020-06-21
--------------------------
> Changed weldlc output to include both time columns
    present in the original .lc files (Raw T-mid and
    BaryCorr T-mid). This way, the column format does
    not change between original and welded light curves.


Version 1.4.6 - 2020-06-21
--------------------------
> Fixed small bugs.


Version 1.5.0 - 2020-06-21
--------------------------
> Found and fixed a significant issue related to the 
    calculation of the Barycentric Julian Date (BJD) at 
    the start of the exposure sequence which gets saved
    as the header keyword BJED in the .lc and .phot files. 
    The BJD should have have been referencing the very
    first image, regardless of whether the first data point
    got removed from the final light curve. Instead, it was
    referencing the first non-deleted data point. The 
    barycentric corrected timestamps were shifted to
    reference this time, so the timings from previous versions
    won't be incorrect, but the raw timings were not shifted
    to reference this time, so large discrepancies could
    sometimes be seen when comparing the raw and barycorr
    time columns. This has been fixed so that the BJED
    keyword now always references the first image of a run,
    and both time columns now reference the same BJED.


Version 1.5.1 - 2020-06-25
--------------------------
> Fixed bug related to improper exposure time format. The
    "get_time" function within photfunc.py assumed that
    FITS header's exposure time value was a float, but
    occasionally it would be a different format. This
    resulted in errors within phot2lc when doing float
    arithmetic on the exposure time parameter. Now, the
    get_time function will convert the exposure time to
    type float upon loading it from the header.


Version 1.5.2 - 2020-06-28
--------------------------
> Fixed the command list printed with "?" to include all
    available options, a few had been missing from the
    "Aperture Selection" list.
> Improved the layout of the Aperture Selection Window.
    - Now show significance thresholds for both the 
      User and Grid periodograms.
    - Uses only red and white color scheme to more
      clearly indicate what lines/markers/values
      correspond to the Grid vs. User light curves.
    - Now shows the maximum signal-noise of the highest
      peak in the periodogram:
     (Max S/N = Max Peak Height / Average Noise Level)
> Created a new command line tool named "quicklook" 
    which generates a plot of an extracted light curve
    along with its periodogram and marks significant
    peaks determined by a pre-whitening routine.


Version 1.5.3 - 2020-07-01
--------------------------
> Forgot to edit the setup.py file to include the new
    "quicklook" tool as a script. Bug has been fixed 
    and quicklook is now available.


Version 1.5.4 - 2020-07-01
--------------------------
> Added more functionality to the "quicklook" tool.
   - Now includes 4 command line options:
       1) -f --files
          Input file(s) to perform quicklook on.
       2) -s --show
          Whether to display the quicklook plot.
       3) -p --prewhiten
          Whether to perform a pre-whitening sequence.
       4) -w --wqedlc
          Whether the input file(s) are from WQED.
       5) -h --help
          Print out command line options.


Version 1.5.5 - 2020-07-01
--------------------------
> Bug in quicklook's import statements. Fixed.


Version 1.5.6 - 2020-07-02
--------------------------
> Improved layout of the periodogram plot in the
    aperture selection window. The y-axis scaling
    no longer pushes the significance threshold
    text off the top of the plot.


Version 1.5.7 - 2020-07-02
--------------------------
> Fixed a bug in quicklook which loaded in the 
    incorrect date for welded phot2lc light curves.


Version 1.5.8 - 2020-07-03
--------------------------
> Fixed bug related to the calculation of an 
    object's declination coordinate after loading it
    from the stars.dat file. Objects with negative
    declinations were being improperly formatted,
    where the minute and second components were being
    added as positive values to the degree value
    instead of being subtracted.
> Due to the above bug, if you have used phot2lc
    prior to this version to calculate barycentric
    corrections for objects with negative declinations,
    it is highly recommended that you rerun phot2lc
    on those objects with this or later versions.


Version 1.5.9 - 2020-07-10
--------------------------
> Updates to the quicklook program. Added new command
    line options for when performing pre-whitening:
    -l --lower, Lower frequency limit for pre-whitening 
                search (micro-Hertz, default = 500).
    -u --upper, Upper frequency limit for pre-whitening 
                search (micro-Hertz, default = 100,000).
    -n --num  , Maximum number of pre-whitening iterations
                (default = 10).
    These new options provide the user with more control
    over the pre-whitening process, in particular when the
    object of interest shows low-frequency variability.

Version 1.5.10 - 2020-07-12
---------------------------
> Improved the x,y coordinates for text in the "First Image"
    window so that each star's label no longer overlaps the
    star or circle marker.
> Added an additional curve to the P2P Scatter vs. Aperture
    size plot when the Grid search option is used. This
    curve, colored red, shows the P2P vs. Ap Size trend for
    the grid search's determination of the optimal comp 
    star combination. 
> Improved y-axis scaling of the periodogram plot in the
    Aperture Selection window.
> Added legend to P2P vs. ApSize plot showing the comparison
    stars used and the minimum P2P scatter value.
> Added a "Time" keyword in the welded light curve header.
> Changed the "UTC" keyword in .lc and .phot file headers to
    "Time" to be consistent with the welded file header.
> The quicklook -s option is now for optionally saving rather
    than optionally showing the resulting plot. The plot is 
    now always shown.
> The quicklook output file naming convention was changed
    from quicklook_object_date.pdf to quicklook_filename.pdf
    where "filename" is the input .lc file's name.
> Fixed bug in photfunc.py's prewhiten function which 
    calculated one more pre-whitening step than requested.


Version 1.5.11 - 2020-07-13
---------------------------
> Small bug fix in the pp_scat function within photfunc.py.
    Denominator should have been N-1, not N.


Version 1.5.12 - 2020-08-05
---------------------------
> Changed .lc and .phot file format. Instead of two time
    columns, there is now only one. The time column is
    either the raw times or the barycentric corrected
    times. The user has control over which output occurs
    using the new -b (--barycorr) command line option
    when calling phot2lc.


Version 1.5.13 - 2020-08-07
---------------------------
> Updated the weldlc and quicklook programs to work 
    properly with the newly formatted .lc file.
> Minor modifications to the quicklook plot format.
    The text displayed on the periodogram plots is
    now positioned more efficiently to prevent overlap.


Version 1.6.0 - 2020-11-15
--------------------------
> Added a new capability to phot2lc which allows Users
  to perform sigma rejections when fitting a polynomial
  to the light curve. This optimizes the fitting procedure
  for objects which are expected to exhibit many points
  below or above the average flux, for example objects
  in eclipsing binaries or flare stars. The -f keyword 
  is still available for simple polynomial fitting without
  sigma rejections where only the polynomial degree needs
  to be defined. A new keword, -F, is used to define the
  sigma rejections parameters:
	- Polymial Degree       , e.g. 3
	- Rejection Iterations  , e.g. 10
	- Lower Sigma Threshold , e.g. 2.5
	- Upper Sigma Threshold , e.g. 5.0
> Fixed the weldlc header which still indicated two time
  time columns were present though now only one is
  included.
> Refined treatment of light curves which have not been
  barycentric corrected. When corrections are not
  performed, the .lc and .phot headers now have "None"
  entered for the BJED value. In addition there is a 
  headder keyword "BaryCorr" with a value of True or
  False indicating whether corrections have been 
  performed.
> Related to the above point, the weldlc header looks
  different now depending on whether the input light 
  curve files have all been barycentric corrected or 
  not. If they have, all of the times referencing the 
  start of the welded light curve (T0) are in TDB time
  scales. If they haven't, the times are instead in the
  UTC scale, or some combination of the UTC and TDB scales. 
  Unless specified using weldlc's new -b (--bypass) option, 
  however, weldlc will throw an error if not ALL of the 
  input light curves have been barycentric corrected. 
  Regardless of whether you use the -b option, though, 
  weldlc still works the same in the sense that it simply 
  takes the time columns from each .lc file and concatenates 
  them together. The only true difference is that the -b 
  option will reference all times to the earliest MJD value 
  found rather than the earliest BJED value.


Version 1.6.1 through 1.6.6 - 2020-11-15
----------------------------------------
> Small bug fixes


Version 1.6.7 - 2021-02-10
--------------------------
> Chooses between QT5agg and TKagg backends for different
  platforms.
> Updated the RTD documentation

Version 1.6.8 - 2021-02-10
--------------------------
> Fallback to DejaVu Sans Mono for non macOSX platforms

Version 1.6.9 - 2021-02-10
--------------------------
> Command line option description and RTD docs updates


Version 1.7.0 - 2022-01-28
--------------------------
> Fixed some dependency issues with Matplotlib 3.5
> Added support for the KPED instrument on the Kitt Peak 2.1m
> Changed the Layout of the Divided Light Curve Panel so that
  the comparison star light curve and divided target light
  curve share the same x-axis for easier identification of
  bad point removal.
> The "s" key command now toggles the display of deleted
  summed comparison star points in addition to the divided
  light curve points.
> Changed the matplotlib backend to be system dependent for
  the quicklook program. QT5Agg was distorted on some
  Linux machines, switched to using TKAgg.
  
  
  
Version 1.7.1 - 2023-02-07
--------------------------
> Added support for the CHIMERA instrument on the Palomar
  200-inch Hale Telescope.
> Changed how error estimation is being performed. The
  photometric noise is now being normalized using the
  comparison star flux as a normalization factor. A 
  scaling factor has also been introduced to help
  reduce over/under estimation of errorbars. The scaling
  factor is designed to make sure that the average 
  1-sigma errorbar matches the standard deviation of the
  light curve.
> Added support for the HiPERCAM photometry pipeline:

  Version 1.2.0
  https://cygnus.astro.warwick.ac.uk/phsaap/hipercam/docs/html/index.html
  
  The photometry source parameter (source) defined in
  the configuration file, or set on the command line
  using the -s or --source option, can now be set to
  "hcm". In this mode, it will assume that a file with
  a name like output*log exists containing the raw 
  photometry. It will also assume that a .hcm file needs
  to be loaded in order to display the first image, and 
  use a HiPERCAM aperture file (.ape) to display the
  initial source aperture positions.
  
  Some caveats for handling HiPERCAM output include:
    - Can only handle single-CCD output.log files. 
      The HiPERCAM pipeline is designed to reduce
      multiple CCDs simulatneously since the actual
      HiPERCAM instrument is a 5-channel photometer,
      but the phot2lc code is not yet designed to
      parse multi-CCD output.
    - So far it has only been tested for data acquired
      from the McDonald 2.1m ProEM instrument or the 
      Palomar 200-in CHIMERA instrument. Data from
      from other instruments reduced using the
      HiPERCAM pipeline may not yet play nice with phot2lc.
      
      
 Version 1.7.2 - 2023-02-08
---------------------------
> Improved error messaging for missing object name
  from the stars.dat file.
> Improved header descriptions for the .lc and .phot files.
    - Added new header row in .lc file listing the IDs of
      comparison stars used to generate divided light curve.
    - Added new header row in both .phot and .lc files 
      naming the observer that acquired the data.
    - Made description of BJED header entry more clear
      in the .lc file.
    - Made description of the Time column in both the 
      .lc and .phot file more clear.
> Added support for Ultracam pipeline output, version
  19/12/2005. Since the ultracam pipeline requires
  specially formatted image files (.ucm), an additional
  script, ucm_utils.py, has been added to the package.
  This script contains functions that can read and decode
  the binary .ucm files, namely the read_ucm function. This 
  code was taken and modified from Tom Marsh's ultracam 
  pipeline package:
  
  https://github.com/trmrsh/trm-ultracam
  
  Such a function was not needed for the HiPERCAM .hcm
  files, since these are basically just FITS files and
  can easily be read with astropy.io.fits.
  
  The photometry source parameter (source) defined in
  the configuration file, or set on the command line
  using the -s or --source option, can now be set to
  "ucm". Similar to the HiPERCAM option, it will assume 
  that a file with a name like output*log exists containing 
  the raw photometry. It will also assume that a .ucm file
  needs to be loaded in order to display the first image,
  and use an ULTRACAM aperture file (.ape) to display the
  initial source aperture positions.


 Version 1.7.3 (2023-02-09)
---------------------------
> Minor bug fixes


 Version 1.7.4 (2023-04-28)
---------------------------
> Added new location info for the Tenerife site of the 
  Las Cumbres Observatory 1.0-m telescopes.
> Added new option for the config.dat file called
  phot_basename, which allows users to specify the base
  filename for the output from the photometry pipeline
  being used (e.g. "runbase" for ccd_hsp or "output.log"
  for ULTRA/HiPERCAM). There is also a new command line
  option for phot2lc (-p, --photname), which allows users
  to specify the basename at runtime or override whatever
  the default value is in the config.dat file.
> Added a new command line convenience program "addstar"
  that allows users to add a new entry into the stars.dat
  file. Example usage:
      addstar SDSSJ0000+1111 00:00:00.0 +11:11:11.1

 Version 1.7.5 (2023-04-28)
---------------------------
> Minor bug fixes


 Version 1.7.6 (2023-05-02)
---------------------------
> Minor bug fixes in addstar


 Version 1.7.7 (2023 May 4)
---------------------------
> Better handling of NaN values in HiPERCAM and 
  ULTRACAM output.
> Better information print out from the addstar 
  command line function.


 Version 1.7.8 (2023 May 16)
----------------------------
> Changed how the light curve "author" is handled. The
  default now is to use your system username, which
  happens when the "author" parameter in the config.dat
  file is set to "sys-user". You can change this parameter
  to any custom value you like by running the photconfig
  script as usual, or there is now a command line option
  -a/--author for phot2lc which allows you to override 
  the value in the config.dat file, e.g.:
  
      phot2lc --author 'Zach Vanderbosch'
      
  This update makes it easier for multiple people to use
  the same phot2lc installation, e.g. on a computer that
  a whole research group may use to store and reduce 
  their data. Now, different users no longer have to run
  the photconfig script to change the author name in order
  to get the correct author metadata into the .lc file.


Version 1.8.0 (2024 July 31)
----------------------------
> Updated the weldlc program to be compatible with the
  updated headers of the .lc files.
> Removed deprecated 'delim_whitespace' parameters from
  pandas read_csv function calls, now using sep='\\s+'
> Fixed all microhertz axis labels from '$\mu$' to '$\\mu$'
  to avoid syntax warnings.
