Version 0.1.0 - All Versions before 2020-06-01
----------------------------------------------
> Created phot2lc.py as a python replacement for
  WQED. Included just the basic functionality
  to work with output from Antonio Kanaan's
  IRAF hsp_nd and data from McDonald Observatory.

Version 1.0.0 - 2020-06-01
--------------------------
> Created the teledat.py and photfunc.py scripts
   -teledat.py stores information related to each 
      telescope and has a unique 4-letter code
      associated with each one. This script is
      similar in purpose to the file whiff.dat
      for WQED.
   -photfunc.py stores several functions used
      within the main script below. This was
      created just to help clean things up.
> Included functionality that allows phot2lc
    to be used with output from both hsp_nd and
    Maestro. For Maestro, only the "counts" files
    can currently be used.
> Improved the formatting for the .lc and .phot
    output files. The headers are now more easily
    readable and contain more information. There
    are also two time columns now, one for the raw
    uncorrected times, and one for the barycentric
    corrected times.

Version 1.1.0 - 2020-06-04
--------------------------
> Created a new function in photfunc.py, get_loc, 
    which gets the Astropy Earth Locations for each 
    telescope available in the teledat.py file
> Added LCOGT 1.0m telescopes to teledat.py with 
    codename 'lco1'
> Fixed bug related to object names. If object name
    taken from the FITS header has any spaces in it,
    those spaces will now be automatically removed, 
    since the object names in stars.dat cannot have 
    spaces.
> Removed plot that shows the size of apertures and
    sky annuli around each object. Too many issues, 
    and not a very useful plot.
> Fixed bug in get_time function. Times were being 
    improperly re-formatted when DATE-OBS was already 
    in ISO or ISOT in the FITS header. Now, these 
    times are fed directly into an Astropy Time object 
    which can auto-interpret the format.

Version 1.2.0 - 2020-06-09
--------------------------
> Added a new command line input parameter for
    providing the object name. Originally the object
    name was grabbed solely from the FITS header, but
    not all FITS files will have an object entry. The
    object name is required, however, for grabbing the
    corresping RA and Dec from the star.dat file.
    Judi Provencal recommended adding a command line
    option. The new command line option is -o, or 
    --object. By default this option is set to None,
    in which case the header is used.
> Changed activation and deactivation functionality 
    of the Garbage and Zoom rectangle selectors. 
    Originally, once activated with the "g" or "z" 
    input keys, they would remain active until 
    deactivated using the same input keys. This would
    lead to some confusion during use, as it was often 
    easy to forget one selector was activated which 
    then blocked activation of the other selector. 
    Now, each selector is automatically deactivated 
    after use, though it can still be manually 
    deactivated if, once a user activates it, they 
    realize they don't want to use it.
> Added a Reverse Garbage Selector which, when you 
    draw a box, will delete all of the points OUTSIDE 
    of the box rather than inside the box. This 
    feature can be activated and deactivated using 
    the "r" keyboard input.


Version 1.3.0 - 2020-06-12
--------------------------
> Added a sigma clipping function. This feature can
    be used with the "x" key. User will be prompted
    for their choice of lower and upper sigma 
    rejection thresholds. The user can also choose
    the window size, i.e. how many points are
    considered at a time when rejecting data points.
    Smaller windows are useful when dealing with
    stars that are variable on short timescales. The
    default window size is 25 data points.
> Changed periodogram calculation/plot so that it
    only goes out to 10,000 uHz, for easier viewing.
> Added "#!/usr/bin/env python" to script so it can
    be executed on the command line without having
    to invoke Python beforehand.
> Also removed .py extension on phot2lc so it looks
    more like a regular executable.
> Removed version history from phot2lc script, it now
    lives only in this text file.
> Cleaned up the inputs. Deleted some unused modules
    and reorganized the rest. Now checks to make sure
    the python version is 3.6 or later.
> Added a new configuration script, a convenience 
    function which new users can use to set the
    defaults. This was needed in order to prevent
    users from having to go into the code and manually
    change hard-coded variables in order to make
    phot2lc work. Now, the "photconfig" function can 
    be called which edits the config.dat file, which
    is then loaded into phot2lc during initialization.

Version 1.3.1 to 1.3.4 - 2020-06-13
-----------------------------------
> Made phot2lc into a python package available on PyPI
> Fixed bugs so that phot2lc and photconfig work
    properly once they have been pip installed



Version 1.4.0 - 2020-06-14
--------------------------
> Removed some extraneous print commands.
> Changed the light curve and photometry header
    descriptions for DATE, UTC, MJD, and BJED to be
    more descriptive.
> Finally got the weldlc functions working again with 
    the new .lc output formats. wildly can be used now 
    to stitch .lc files together for multi-night or
    multi-site data sets.



Version 1.4.1 - 2020-06-14
--------------------------
> Small changes to the PyPI README.md file


Version 1.4.2 - 2020-06-14
--------------------------
> config.dat didn't get uploaded with the previous
    version due to an error in setup.py. Fixed the
    error and this version appears fully functional.

Version 1.4.3 - 2020-06-14
--------------------------
> Forgot to include the most up-to-date version of
    this file (version_history.txt) with the last
    one. Now it should be complete.

Version 1.4.4 - 2020-06-15
--------------------------
> A few small bug fixes.
> Fixed an indexing error related to the grid search.
    The wrong index was being used to save information
    into the output .phot files related to the optimal 
    aperture being used when using "G" to save the
    final light curve. This has been fixed in this
    version.
    

Version 1.4.5 - 2020-06-21
--------------------------
> Changed weldlc output to include both time columns
    present in the original .lc files (Raw T-mid and
    BaryCorr T-mid). This way, the column format does
    not change between original and welded light curves.


Version 1.4.6 - 2020-06-21
--------------------------
> Fixed small bugs.


Version 1.5.0 - 2020-06-21
--------------------------
> Found and fixed a significant issue related to the 
    calculation of the Barycentric Julian Date (BJD) at 
    the start of the exposure sequence which gets saved
    as the header keyword BJED in the .lc and .phot files. 
    The BJD should have have been referencing the very
    first image, regardless of whether the first data point
    got removed from the final light curve. Instead, it was
    referencing the first non-deleted data point. The 
    barycentric corrected timestamps were shifted to
    reference this time, so the timings from previous versions
    won't be incorrect, but the raw timings were not shifted
    to reference this time, so large discrepancies could
    sometimes be seen when comparing the raw and barycorr
    time columns. This has been fixed so that the BJED
    keyword now always references the first image of a run,
    and both time columns now reference the same BJED.


Version 1.5.1 - 2020-06-25
--------------------------
> Fixed bug related to improper exposure time format. The
    "get_time" function within photfunc.py assumed that
    FITS header's exposure time value was a float, but
    occasionally it would be a different format. This
    resulted in errors within phot2lc when doing float
    arithmetic on the exposure time parameter. Now, the
    get_time function will convert the exposure time to
    type float upon loading it from the header.


Version 1.5.2 - 2020-06-28
--------------------------
> Fixed the command list printed with "?" to include all
    available options, a few had been missing from the
    "Aperture Selection" list.
> Improved the layout of the Aperture Selection Window.
    - Now show significance thresholds for both the 
      User and Grid periodograms.
    - Uses only red and white color scheme to more
      clearly indicate what lines/markers/values
      correspond to the Grid vs. User light curves.
    - Now shows the maximum signal-noise of the highest
      peak in the periodogram:
     (Max S/N = Max Peak Height / Average Noise Level)
> Created a new command line tool named "quicklook" 
    which generates a plot of an extracted light curve
    along with its periodogram and marks significant
    peaks determined by a pre-whitening routine.


Version 1.5.3 - 2020-07-01
--------------------------
> Forgot to edit the setup.py file to include the new
    "quicklook" tool as a script. Bug has been fixed 
    and quicklook is now available.


Version 1.5.4 - 2020-07-01
--------------------------
> Added more functionality to the "quicklook" tool.
   - Now includes 4 command line options:
       1) -f --files
          Input file(s) to perform quicklook on.
       2) -s --show
          Whether to display the quicklook plot.
       3) -p --prewhiten
          Whether to perform a pre-whitening sequence.
       4) -w --wqedlc
          Whether the input file(s) are from WQED.
       5) -h --help
          Print out command line options.


Version 1.5.5 - 2020-07-01
--------------------------
> Bug in quicklook's import statements. Fixed.


Version 1.5.6 - 2020-07-02
--------------------------
> Improved layout of the periodogram plot in the
    aperture selection window. The y-axis scaling
    no longer pushes the significance threshold
    text off the top of the plot.


Version 1.5.7 - 2020-07-02
--------------------------
> Fixed a bug in quicklook which loaded in the 
    incorrect date for welded phot2lc light curves.


Version 1.5.8 - 2020-07-03
--------------------------
> Fixed bug related to the calculation of an 
    object's declination coordinate after loading it
    from the stars.dat file. Objects with negative
    declinations were being improperly formatted,
    where the minute and second components were being
    added as positive values to the degree value
    instead of being subtracted.
> Due to the above bug, if you have used phot2lc
    prior to this version to calculate barycentric
    corrections for objects with negative declinations,
    it is highly recommended that you rerun phot2lc
    on those objects with this or later versions.


Version 1.5.9 - 2020-07-10
--------------------------
> Updates to the quicklook program. Added new command
    line options for when performing pre-whitening:
    -l --lower, Lower frequency limit for pre-whitening 
                search (micro-Hertz, default = 500).
    -u --upper, Upper frequency limit for pre-whitening 
                search (micro-Hertz, default = 100,000).
    -n --num  , Maximum number of pre-whitening iterations
                (default = 10).
    These new options provide the user with more control
    over the pre-whitening process, in particular when the
    object of interest shows low-frequency variability.

Version 1.5.10 - 2020-07-12
---------------------------
> Improved the x,y coordinates for text in the "First Image"
    window so that each star's label no longer overlaps the
    star or circle marker.
> Added an additional curve to the P2P Scatter vs. Aperture
    size plot when the Grid search option is used. This
    curve, colored red, shows the P2P vs. Ap Size trend for
    the grid search's determination of the optimal comp 
    star combination. 
> Improved y-axis scaling of the periodogram plot in the
    Aperture Selection window.
> Added legend to P2P vs. ApSize plot showing the comparison
    stars used and the minimum P2P scatter value.
> Added a "Time" keyword in the welded light curve header.
> Changed the "UTC" keyword in .lc and .phot file headers to
    "Time" to be consistent with the welded file header.
> The quicklook -s option is now for optionally saving rather
    than optionally showing the resulting plot. The plot is 
    now always shown.
> The quicklook output file naming convention was changed
    from quicklook_object_date.pdf to quicklook_filename.pdf
    where "filename" is the input .lc file's name.
> Fixed bug in photfunc.py's prewhiten function which 
    calculated one more pre-whitening step than requested.
